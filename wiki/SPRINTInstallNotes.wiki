Quick install notes for installing SPRINT. 


= Ubuntu 10 =
With standard packages providing MPICH2 1.2.1p1 and R 2.10.1. 

The Ubuntu R package puts the  R include files in /usr/share/R/include/ instead of the standard $R_HOME/include or /usr/lib/R/include so the installer cannot find the include files. 

To fix this you need to run:

`$ cd /usr/lib/R/`

`$ ln -s /usr/share/R/include .`

Then compile normally

`$ R CMD INSTALL sprint-X.X.tgz`

You also need to have a working mpi setup and mpd running.
