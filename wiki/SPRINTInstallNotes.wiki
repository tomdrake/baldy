Quick install notes for installing SPRINT. 


= Ubuntu 10 =
With standard packages providing MPICH2 1.2.1p1 and R 2.10.1. 

The Ubuntu R package puts the  R include files in /usr/share/R/include/ instead of the standard $R_HOME/include or /usr/lib/R/include so the installer cannot find the include files. 

To fix this you need to run:

`$ cd /usr/lib/R/`

`$ ln -s /usr/share/R/include .`

Then compile normally

`$ R CMD INSTALL sprint-X.X.tgz`

You also need to have a working mpi setup and mpd running.

= Fedora 13 =
== MPICH2 ==
Install the packages that are needed


`$ yum install R R-devel mpich2 mpich2-devel`


Add a link so sprint can find the R headers


`ln -s /usr/include/R/ /usr/lib/R/include`


compile


`R CMD INSTALL sprint-0.2/`


== openmpi NOT WORKING YET==
Install the packages that are needed

`$ yum install R R-devel openmpi openmpi-devel`

Put the R include files where the installer expects them

`ln -s /usr/include/R/ /usr/lib/R/include`

Add mpicc to the path

`export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/openmpi/bin/`

Add openmpi libs to the path

`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/openmpi/lib/:/usr/lib/openmpi/lib/openmpi/`

Compile 

`R CMD INSTALL sprint-0.2/`

Gives this error
